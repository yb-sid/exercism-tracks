# Exercism Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various coding exercises from different tracks on [Exercism](https://exercism.io/). Exercism is a platform that offers coding challenges to help developers improve their programming skills in various programming languages.

## About Exercism

[Exercism](https://exercism.io/) is a platform that provides a wide range of programming exercises in various languages. It offers a supportive community, mentorship, and a structured learning path to help you improve your coding skills.

## Languages

Here are the programming languages and tracks for which I've provided solutions:

- Java
- Python
- Scala
- Go
- Javascript

You can explore each language's directory to find my solutions and README files for individual exercises.

## Directory Structure

- **Java**: Folder for solutions in Java.
    Note : This sub-folder uses maven as a build tool
  - **src/main/java/com.ybsid.exercism**: Package path to all solutions
    - `exercise_name.java`: My solution code.
  - **src/test/java/com.ybsid.exercism**: package path for tests for each exercise


- **Python**: Folder for solutions in Python3.
    Note : pytest is used as python testing framework.  
    Virtual environment is used to manage packages.
  - **src/exercises/`exercise`**: Package path to all solutions
    - `exercise_name.py`: My solution code.
    - `exercise_name_test.py` : test class used to test solution

- **Scala**: Folder for solutions in Scala(2).
    Note : Exercism does not support latest Scala-3 , but some of my solutions will contain scala-3 implementations as well.  
    The sub-project uses sbt as build too.
    Use Intellij-Idea as IDE to run scala test files as VS code support is not great.
  - **src/main/scala/com.ybsid.exercism**: Package path to all solutions
    - `exercise_name.scala`: My solution code.
  - **src/test/scala/com.ybsid.exercism**: package path for tests for each exercise

## Future commits will include Go and Javascript/TypeScript as well
